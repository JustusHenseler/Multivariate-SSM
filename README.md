# Multivariate-SSM (WIP)  

This package aims to provide a state-space framework for forecasting multivariate time series models with GARCH errors, which can be used for yield curve forecasting. 
The covariance matrix updating is based on the structure of [Koopman et al. (2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jbes.2009.07295). Currently, the project is in active development.  

## Planned Features  
- State-space representation of DNS-factors
- Kalman filtering & smoothing  
- GARCH-based covariance updating as described in [Koopman et al. (2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jbes.2009.07295).  
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of model parameters
